                <h2>Starting out </h2>
                <p>  Climate change is a problem that is causing many young people stress, and introducing them to doomerism.The introduction of doomerism is very dangerous especially in regards to young people like us.
                    Me and my colleagues noticed this rising trend and decided to build this organisation so as to get across to young people. The creation of this organisation led us to meet so many young people. We reached out to so many different climate justice activist to gide us towards the right path.
